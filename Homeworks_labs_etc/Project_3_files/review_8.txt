When compared to its predecessor, Black Panther, also directed by Ryan Coogler, the world's most profitable Black director (though that status did not protect him from a racially charged bad encounter with the law), the form and execution of Wakanda Forever's narrative is, without question, inferior. Also, the absence of the late and great Chadwick Boseman haunts the picture. His presence is not only missed but still very much needed. The political content of Wakanda Forever, however, is far more radical than that of Black Panther.
