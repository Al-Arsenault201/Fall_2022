Wakanda is grieving the sudden death of King T'Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman). As his mother Queen Ramonda (Bassett) and sister Princess Shuri (Wright) face putting their lives back together, they discover a new threat from the hidden nation Talokan, which shares their technological advantage through the extraterrestrial mineral vibranium. Based in an underwater kingdom off the coast of Mexico, ruler Namor (Huerta) may be proposing an alliance, but his methods put Wakanda on the defence, as top spy Nakia (Nyong'o), local leader M'Baku (Duke) and warriors (including Gurira, Kasumba and Coel) spring into action.

Because the film circles around issues of grief, its narrative is much more introspective than expected. Each plot point springs from decisions made at moments of vulnerability, so the primary trajectory of the story is within the characters. This makes the film involving and often powerfully moving, and adds a proper twist to questions about whether someone should take on the heroic mantle of Black Panther. None of this plays out simplistically, as scenes undercut over-serious dialog with sharp humour, surprising action and big revelations.
