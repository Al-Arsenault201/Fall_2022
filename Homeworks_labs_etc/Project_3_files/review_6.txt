A decade ago, it would have been unthinkable for Hollywood to produce a superhero film in which all the lead characters were black African women. Even less likely was that the United States would play the role of the villain – an irresponsible superpower that can’t be trusted to preserve world peace. Welcome to 2022, and Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.
If all these revolutionary developments resulted in a cinematic masterpiece, I’d be quick to sing its praises, but this is another of those occasions when I feel like the only sober person at a bacchanal, or perhaps the only drunk at a solemn church service. For the bacchanal, vide the outpouring of over-the-top praise the film has received, both from the critics and from fans on social media. It’s beautiful, poignant, poetic, moving, heartbreaking, and anything else you can imagine
