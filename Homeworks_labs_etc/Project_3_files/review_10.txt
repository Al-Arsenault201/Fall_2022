Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) puts on a brave face, while a globe full of rival nations looks to pillage Wakanda in the absence of the Black Panther. Her daughter Shuri (Letitia Wright) throws herself into her science experiments, shunning the spiritual side of their culture entirely. General Okoye (Danai Gurira) frets for them both, and Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) hasn’t shown her face in Wakanda since before The Blip, the cosmic catastrophe from “Avengers: Infinity War,” where half of the universe’s population was blinked out of existence.
In this crossover-happy cinematic universe where every corner of Marvel interacts with every other, Wakanda and her citizens feel more isolated than ever. In the first act, director and co-writer Ryan Coogler stage stirring displays of Girl Power™ and Black Excellence™ to show that Wakanda’s women are holding down the fort. Still, the West’s thirst for Vibranium looms large.
