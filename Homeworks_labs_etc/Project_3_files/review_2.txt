The loss of King T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), aka Black Panther, weighs heavily on the people of Wakanda. More so on his sister Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) and his mother Queen Ramonda (Angel Bassett). They try to move forward but are paralyzed with grief. A sorrow so deep it shadows their attempts to keep their nation safe. Outside forces covet their precious metal Vibranium, which absorbs, stores and releases super amounts of kinetic energy. They must remain vigilant.
The royals think they are alone in their struggle against the outer world, until they encounter an interloper. Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía, Son of Monarchs) is the emperor of the hidden undersea kingdom of Talokan. His people are of Mayan ancestry. He offers them an opportunity to fight mutual enemies. “You want to burn the world? We’ll burn it together.” Can he be trusted? Is combat against anyone the answer? Some say no: “If you go to war for vengeance, it will never fill the hole in your soul.”
