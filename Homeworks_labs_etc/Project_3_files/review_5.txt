f that seems more introspective than a superhero clash, let alone one with battles on air, sea, and soil, it also feels right. Boseman’s death in 2020 at 43 from colon cancer, an illness he hid save for his inner circle, rocked the close-knit cast and crew, plus legions of fans. Some were too young to have seen his portrayals of pioneers such as Thurgood Marshall (2017’s Marshall) and Jackie Robinson (2013’s 42), but here, just as they got to know—and wanted to emulate—this charismatic king, he was gone. Not just disintegrated into dust, like half the Marvel universe in Avengers: Infinity War, then brought back a year later in Avengers: Endgame. But for real.
Wakanda Forever, then, had a tall order to fill, and if it’s flawed in parts, it also acknowledges this loss and moves forward in a way that’s ultimately satisfying. The plot is sometimes messy, with many moving parts, but the film gives its actors—especially Wakanda’s formidable women—powerful performances and moments to shine.
