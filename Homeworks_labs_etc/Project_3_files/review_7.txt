There’s an old TV tropes page, given the title “Reed Richards Is Useless” some digital eons ago, that describes a paradoxical condition of comic book fiction: if a character is possessed with limitless intelligence, to the point that they can transcend reality itself through technology or augment themselves to become immensely powerful beings, they’re oftentimes prevented from more mundane but equally as horrible problems within the world around. Providing food to the hungry, helping to end energy crises and prevent global warming, or discovering cures for deadly diseases – all of these take a backseat to exploration or beating up superpowered threats from another galaxy when they show up next to the ISS. There are plenty of reasons for this, all of which are designed to protect the idea of the superhero from the implications of his very existence and to maintain the suspension of disbelief. If the recognizable problems within, say, the Marvel Universe, find themselves mitigated by Tony Stark or whomever, the reader will cease to find themselves and their neighbors in the text, which is a problem often endemic to superhero fiction, given those characters’ presence in a reality that’s similar to ours but just oh-so-slightly different, not to mention how it would rob the MCU of many of its little quips and pop culture references. There have been, of course, plenty of fantastic comics written exploring this trend, but they’re often given definitive endings (provided DC Comics doesn’t keep your masterwork in circulation for 40 years until they can have your blue-cocked and hung protagonist face off against Superman). Changes to the status quo are, of course, temporary — even Bucky could not stay dead, after all — and the mean will be regressed towards at some point.
